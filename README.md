# ic10compiler README

## Features

Simplified IC10 code for the game Stationeers to save space. Replaces defines and aliases, and pre-calculates hashes. This allows you to write more readable code without worrying about sacrificing space.

## How to use

Install the ic10Compiler plugin for VSCode and run "Compile IC10" on your file.

This will create a new file in the same directory with the prefixed "compiled_" with the simplified IC10 program.
